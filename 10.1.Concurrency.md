## Concurrency
Let there is a queue of 6 subTasks and we divide it into 2 rows (3 each) 
and these tasks run simultaneously using two cores of CPU => Called Parallelization
i.e. multiple tasks can run in parallel.

But if we don't have multiple cores or if the language doesn't support parallelization
there is a way to make task look parallel by dividing the time between the tasks.
ex- for above two rows of 3 subTasks each first the task1 gets executed 
then task4 gets executed ... 

It appears that the two tasks are running in parallel.

#### Both above ways are achieving concurrency in their own way...
##### Js interpreter doesn't  support parallelization so we opt the second way

To make tasks run in serial manner and not concurrently we use callback fun, promises
, and async fun so that a task gets executed only when the earlier task is finished.

We can control which tasks run in serial and which run concurrently.
